[Getting Smart About Social Media: Adoption and Engagement](https://github.com/clayne237/chinalayne.us/blob/master/Publications/Review%20of%20social%20media%20adoption%20and%20engagement%20trends.pdf) is the first in a series of three posts intended to help me get a basic familiarity with key facts, trends, and concepts related to social media (SM) adoption and engagement. In this post, I’ll focus on the current state of, and recent trends in, SM adoption and engagement, demographic differences in SM usage, and SM usage across the world. My expectation isn’t to create a complete literature review, but to develop a baseline understanding of the topic from which I can generate some useful and interesting questions.
