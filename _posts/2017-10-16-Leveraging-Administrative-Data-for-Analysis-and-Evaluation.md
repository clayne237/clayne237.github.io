At this year’s [Association of Public Data User’s (APDU) conference](https://www.summitllc.us/blog/apdu.org), I chaired a panel for [Summit Consulting](https://www.summitllc.us/), [Data Integration for Improving Program Effectiveness](http://apdu.org/education/conference/2017-annual-conference/agenda-2017-annual-conference/), as a workshop for conference attendees. Anthony Curcio, a partner at Summit Consulting, talked with leaders from the [US Securities Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/), the [US Department of Labor](https://www.dol.gov/), and [ByteCubed](http://bytecubed.com/) about how they use administrative data for research to improve federal agencies’ programs and policies. 

<h5>Using Administrative Data Throughout the Program Cycle</h5>
<img class="left" src="/assets/ProgramCycleSmall.png"> To accompanythe panel, I authored a white paper, [Leveraging Administrative Data for Analysis and Evaluation](https://github.com/clayne237/chinalayne.us/blob/master/Publications/2017%20APDU%20white%20paper/Leveraging%20Administrative%20Data%20Final%20PDF.pdf). The paper reviews four best practices for getting started using internal data for programmatic research:(1) Ensure data quality, (2) Integrate disparate sources, (3) Link to external data sources, and (4) Use appropriate analytic methods. For organizations that want to go further, the paper discusses three recommendations for fully integrating administrative data into a research agenda. Together, [Leveraging Administrative Data](https://github.com/clayne237/chinalayne.us/blob/master/Publications/2017%20APDU%20white%20paper/Leveraging%20Administrative%20Data%20Final%20PDF.pdf) provides concrete solutions for both governmental agencies and nonprofit organizations to effectively use their internal data for analysis.
