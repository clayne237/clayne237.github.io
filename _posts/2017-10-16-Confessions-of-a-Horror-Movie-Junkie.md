I can't deny it; I'm a life-long horror movie fan. Over the years, I've managed at least to upgrade from slasher flicks to more thoughtful horror movies and avoid the swamp of 'torture porn', but I just can't quit the genre. Following are some of the films that I've especially enjoyed. The list isn't meant to be definitive in anyway, just a few gems that you might want to check out in the nights leading up to Halloween.

<h5>Straightforward Genre, Well-Done</h5>
<img class="left" src="/assets/halloweenThumb.png"> [The Crazies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455407/) (2010) is in the same vein of "societal collapse" as most modern zombie movies (although the "zombies" here are people exposed to a toxin). But there's enough focus on the main characters and town pre-collapse to make the town's breakdown actually affecting.
[Hush](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5022702/) (2016) was a home-invasion movie I actually liked; focused and well-structured with an engaging protagonist. There is also a scene between the villian and a would-be rescuer that was really interesting for illustrating the perils of how a lot of us automatically respond to authority figures.

<h5>Horror with a Side of Comedy</h5>
After _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, _Angel_, _Firefly_, and, yes, even _Dollhouse_, I knew I'd most likely enjoy [The Cabin in the Woods](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259521/) (2012) and the movie didn't disappoint. Meta-commentary on the horror genre, wise-cracking humor, and a polytheistic world infused with magic; what you know and, likely, are a fan of already.
[Dead Snow](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1278340/) (2009) has a similar premise to _The Cabin in the Woods_, but this Norwegian offering ups the ante by adding in gold-obsessed Nazi zombies. It's much better than my blurb makes it sound.

<h5>When Homecooking Just Won't Do</h5>
[Let the Right One In](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139797/) is what happens when you strip vampirism of its romantic gloss and situate the story in the drab, frigid landscape of a Swedish housing block in winter. There's also a surprisingly tender coming-of-age love story nestled inside the overall creepiness of this film.
[The Brood](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078908/) (1979) and [The Fly](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091064/) (1986) are two of my favorite Cronenberg films. They both go beyond straightforward scares to examine the human tragedy that can make the best horror movies so disturbing: how Nola's rage at the breakup of her family in _The Brood_ ends up hurting the people she loves and Seth's degeneration into "BrundleFly" in _The Fly_. 
I'm not sure what [Borgman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954315/) (2013) is an allegory for, but it seemed to me like a modern fairy tale. I don't mean the Disney version of fairy tales where Tinkerbell is a helpmate for Peter Pan, but folklore where fairies are liars and thieves who lead travelers astray and steal people's babies.
Three words to describe the progression of [Funny Games](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119167/) (1997) (2007) are disturbing, horrifying, and bleak. In some ways the movie shows how our (beneficial) social norms against violence leave us wholly unprepared to deal with actors who operate outside those norms.
One of my all-time favorite movies, [The Thing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/) (1982), combines terror, paranoia and isolation into a very potent mix. I usually don't like unresolved endings, but the ending here fits right in with the movie's overall theme of uncertainty.
