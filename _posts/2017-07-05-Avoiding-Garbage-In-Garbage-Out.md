In June, I presented the webinar, [“Improving Administrative Data Quality for Research and Analysis”](https://github.com/clayne237/chinalayne.us/blob/master/Publications/2017%20Improving%20Admin%20Data/APDU%202017%20admin%20data%20quality%20webinar%206.21.17.pdf), for members of the Association of Public Data Users (APDU). [APDU](http://apdu.org/) is a national network that provides a venue to promote education, share news, and advocate on behalf of public data users.

<h5>In Research, Garbage In - Garbage Out</h5>

<img class="left" src="/assets/GIGO.jpg">The webinar served as a primer to help smaller organizations begin to use their data for research. Participants were given the tools to transform their administrative data into “research-ready” datasets.

I first reviewed seven major issues for administrative data quality and discussed how these issues can affect research and analysis. For instance, issues with incorrect value formats, unit of analysis, and duplicate records can make the data difficult to use. Invalid or inconsistent values lead to inaccurate analysis results. Missing or outlier values can produce inaccurate and biased analysis results. All these issues make the data less useful for research.

Next, I presented concrete strategies for reviewing the data to identify each of these quality issues. I also discussed several tips to make the data review process easier, faster, and easy to replicate. Most importantly among these tips are: (1) reviewing every variable in the data set, whether you expect problems or not, and (2) relying on data documentation to understand how the data should look.

Lastly, I reviewed concrete strategies for resolving these data quality issues. The strategies fall into three main categories: editing the data, deleting the data, or making no change to the data. Choosing which method to use depends on the extent and severity of the data quality issue and the availability of confirmation information. For instance, outlier values can be resolved through data editing, i.e., top- or bottom-coding the variable and duplicate record issues can be resolved through deleting the extra records. However, resolving invalid or inconsistent values through data editing should be done cautiously and only when there’s information to confirm the correct value. The webinar concluded with some helpful tips to make data cleaning easier and more systematic.
